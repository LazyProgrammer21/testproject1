the Rainbow

when i was a child,
I was excited to see rainbow
while playing with crossbow.

it has seven color
i usedd to play mud on floor.
ahh my cloths were dirty
mom didn't scrim because i was trikey.

i had a friend 
whose friendship never ended 
like the color of rainbow
we both used head bow


i love to go date with her
and she would love me playing her hair
we were never fear
i used to byte her ear..lmao
